A workshop covering the natural and unnatural history of a once-abundant species, *Rana boylii*.
Workshop materials cover the [**life history**]{.dark-green}, [**habitat use**]{.orange}, and [**ecology**]{.dark-red} of the species, as well provide conservation status.

Survey methodology and field techniques for monitoring the species are also be covered. This workshop provides an understanding of how water management, population decline, and landscape change have impacted the species, and what it will mean for biologists monitoring the species.
