## Question 1.

a) Create a character vector named `flavors` that contains the following strings and print it: 
    - Cookies & Cream
    - Americone Dream (R)
    - Bob Marley's 1 Love
b) Use a function to calculate the number of strings in `flavors`.
c) Use another function to calculate the number of characters in each string in `flavors`.
d) Let R know how you feel about ice cream by using a function to either make all the characters in `flavors` uppercase (you LOVE ice cream) or lowercase (you don't love ice cream).

## Question 2.

The following table summarizes the season information for the eight seasons of AMC's *Breaking Bad* show. 

a) Tidy up this data and save it to a tibble. Decide for yourself how to handle season 5 (should it be a single observation or two?). For the first and last aired dates, just store the year as a number.

b) Save the tibble you created to a CSV file named "breaking_bad.csv".

**Answer (a)**

Version with one observation for the season five parts

```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
season <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
episodes <- c(7, 13, 13, 13, 16)
first_air <- c(2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012)
last_air <- c(2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013)
network <- "AMC"
breaking_bad <- 
  tibble(season, episodes, first_air, last_air, network)
breaking_bad
```

Version with two separate observations for the season five parts

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
season <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5.1, 5.2)
episodes <- c(7, 13, 13, 13, 8, 8)
first_air <- c(2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013)
last_air <- c(2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013)
network <- "AMC"
breaking_bad <- 
  tibble(season, episodes, first_air, last_air, network)
breaking_bad
```

**Answer (b)**

```{r}
#| message: false
#| eval: false

write_csv(breaking_bad, "breaking_bad.csv")
```
