::: notes
Taking care of the world, whether we call it conservation, stewardship, or sustainability, depends on the accurate portraits of places, processes, and organisms provided by natural history. It is impossible to devise an effective conservation plan for an endangered species that we know nothing about (indeed, we would not even know that species was endangered without carefully natural history observations), or to prioritize habitats for protection if we do not know their extent or what relationships they harbor.

The story begins roughly 370 million years ago in the Devonian. Lobe-finned fish with primitive lungs or multi-jointed leg-like fins (Tetrapods). Were top predators prior to evolution of reptiles. Caecilians and salamanders more closely related than frogs, and diverged ~250 mya in early Mesozoic before breakup of Pangea.

::: notes
Frogs were associated with the annual flooding of the Nile. Frogs have been associated with repeating life in many cultures, meaning they have been resilient to many environmental/geologic changes that have occurred through our history and beyond.

In many Native American cultures frogs represent the ability to travel between two worlds, communicate with all beings in both worlds and serve as mediators.

Unfortunately they have not been resilient to us.

## A Karuk Story of the Upstream People (*The Fire Race*){.smaller background-color="#555555"}

::: notes
Long ago only the three Yellow Jacket sisters had fire. Even though other animals froze, the fire was kept from them. Coyote wanted to steal fire, which had been lost in a bet. He collected various animals, and placed them at intervals from the river to the mountains. Frog was in the first place—closest to the river. There was forest fire in the mountains, and he stole it by diverting the children who were in charge of it, and then pretending to fall asleep by the fire, having placed oak bark between his toes. At the right moment, he ran away with a piece of burning charcoal. The ember was passed from one animal to the next as each got tired. Turtle was able to escape by rolling down from a mountaintop towards the river, and then gave it to Frog. Frog hid the fire in his mouth, dived in the river and swam to the other side, and spat the fire out under a Willow. Dogs howled as the fire rose up, and mankind came into existence.

Natural History: Species Overview
:::


::: notes
R. boylii was first described by Baird (1854). A half century of taxonomic uncertainty followed with several name changes (Zweifel 1968). Since 1955, Rana boylii has been recognized as a distinct species in the family Ranidae (Zweifel 1955, Collins 1990). Zweifel (1955) described six species in the R. boylii group. R. boylii’s closest relative, both geographically and phylogenetically, is Rana muscosa. The four other ranids included in the R. boylii group by Zweifel (R. pustulosa, R. tarahumarae, R. pueblae, and R. moori) occur in Mexico, the latter extending into southern Arizona. Subsequent research suggests minor modifications to Zweifel’s work on the R. boylii group (Dumas 1966, Green 1986a, Green 1986b). No subspecies of R. boylii are known to date, but detailed genetic analysis may reveal cryptic taxa (Jennings and Hayes 1994)

#### **THE BASICS**

1. Adults breed in the spring (*amplexus*)
2. Females pick oviposition location
3. External fertilization, 1 egg mass per year
4. After hatching tadpoles cannot swim ~5 days
5. Tadpoles require 2.5 months at 18C or greater
6. Metamorphosis in late summer/fall
