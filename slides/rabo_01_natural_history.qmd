Natural History

::: notes
Frogs were associated with the annual flooding of the Nile. Frogs have been associated with repeating life in many cultures, meaning they have been resilient to many environmental/geologic changes that have occurred through our history and beyond.

In many Native American cultures frogs represent the ability to travel between two worlds, communicate with all beings in both worlds and serve as mediators.

Unfortunately they have not been resilient to us.

## *Rana boylii*

::: columns

::: incremental
 - First described by Baird (1854)
 - Later recognized as distinct species by Zweifel in 1955, looked at 565 adults and juveniles.
 - Max body size ~73mm (SVL)
 - Adults typically >=35mm

Natural History: Species Overview
:::


::: notes
R. boylii was first described by Baird (1854). A half century of taxonomic uncertainty followed with several name changes (Zweifel 1968). Since 1955, Rana boylii has been recognized as a distinct species in the family Ranidae (Zweifel 1955, Collins 1990). Zweifel (1955) described six species in the R. boylii group. R. boylii’s closest relative, both geographically and phylogenetically, is Rana muscosa. The four other ranids included in the R. boylii group by Zweifel (R. pustulosa, R. tarahumarae, R. pueblae, and R. moori) occur in Mexico, the latter extending into southern Arizona. Subsequent research suggests minor modifications to Zweifel’s work on the R. boylii group (Dumas 1966, Green 1986a, Green 1986b). No subspecies of R. boylii are known to date, but detailed genetic analysis may reveal cryptic taxa (Jennings and Hayes 1994)

 - Range from Upper San Gabriel River in CA to Willamette Valley, OR

::: {.fragment .mt1}
 - Two specimens were collected in 1965 in Baja California (Loomis 1965), but never detected after (Welsh 1988, Hollingsworth 2000, Grismer 2002, Stebbins 2003).

#### The Basics

1. Adults breed in the spring (*amplexus*)
2. Females pick oviposition location
3. External fertilization, egg masses ~2-3 weeks
4. After hatching tadpoles cannot swim ~5 days
5. Tadpoles require 2.5 months 18C or greater
6. Metamorphosis in late summer/fall
