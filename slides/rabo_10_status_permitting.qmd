## CESA Definitions

::: {style="font-size: 88%;"}

 - [**Endangered**]{.dark-red}: A native species or subspecies of bird, mammal, fish<sup>+</sup>, amphibian, reptile, or plant which is in <b>serious danger of becoming extinct throughout all, or a significant portion, of its range</b> due to one or more causes, including loss of habitat, change in habitat, overexploitation, predation, competition, or disease  (<sup>+</sup> includes invertebrates)
 - [**Threatened**]{.orange}: A native species or subspecies of a bird, mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile, or plant that, although <b>not presently threatened with extinction, is likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future</b> in the absence of the special protection and management efforts required by the California Endangered Species Act (CESA).

:::

## Administrative Status Designation {.smaller}

[**California Species of Special Concern (SSC)**]{.f2 .blue}

 - Carries no formal legal status; however, SSCs should be considered during the environmental review process.
    - The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires lead agencies to evaluate and disclose impacts from "projects" in the State. Section 15380 of the CEQA Guidelines indicates that species should be included in project impact analyses if they can be shown to meet the criteria of sensitivity outlined therein.
 - [The intent of designating SSCs is to:]{.purple}
    - Focus attention on animals at conservation risk by the Department, other State, local and Federal governmental entities, regulators, land managers, planners, consulting biologists, and others;
    - Stimulate research on poorly known species; and
    - Achieve conservation and recovery of these animals before they meet CESA criteria for listing as [threatened]{.orange} or [endangered]{.dark-red}.

## Scientific Collecting Permits {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

### [COVERAGE]{.f2}

## Broad Definition of Propagation {.smaller}

::: {style="font-size: 130%;"}

“Propagation" means captive breeding, captive rearing, and other activities that help sustain or increase wildlife populations for scientific, conservation, management, or educational purposes, such as:

:::

::: {style="font-size: 115%;"}

 - Removal of non-native, invasive, or detrimental wildlife to improve or restore ecosystem or habitat conditions, or otherwise enhance the sustainability of native wildlife or other species.
 - Management responses necessary to prevent catastrophic wildlife population losses from drought, mudslides, wildfires, disease outbreaks, and other natural or man-made disasters, or to capture, temporarily possess, and relocate wildlife to avoid harm or mortality in connection with otherwise lawful activities.

:::

## [Permits for Common Activities]{style="font-size: 90%;"}{.scrollable}

What is the purpose, and is the species CESA protected?

::: {style="font-size: 72%;"}

 - Species surveys<sup>[+]{.b .purple}</sup> 
    - Scientific research: SCP and/or MOU
    - Education/training: SCP or MOU
    - Pre-project biological impact assessments: SCP or MOU
    - Post-project effectiveness monitoring: SCP, MOU, or RMP
 - Movement out of harm’s way
    - General projects: SCP, ITP, NCCPP, etc.
    - Habitat restoration projects: SCP and/or MOU, or RMP
    - Emergency (natural disaster/drought) rescues: SCP or MOU

 - <sup>+</sup>[Passive surveys (e.g., VES) with no handling do not require a permit]{.b .purple}

## Take Aways

::: {.columns .pv4}

::: {.column width="55%"}

::: {.nonincremental}

 - State and federal listing status consistent except Northern Sierra clade/DPS
 - Take and possession always require a permit from CDFW regardless of location in CA
 - The purpose for the take or possession and the regulatory status of the species determine the permit type required
