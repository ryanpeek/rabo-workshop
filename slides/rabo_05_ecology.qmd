::: notes
Some climate change scenarios predict larger winter floods and drier summers, which would favor cyanobacteria proliferations. Anthropogenic water withdrawals further depress summertime river discharges, also increasing the likelihood of cyanotoxin production.
For more information see http://angelo.berkeley.edu/research/res-proj/
Parasitic copepods and trematodes also proliferate at higher temperatures, decrease size, cause malformations, and mortality

Tradeoff: 

  - Dessication vs. Disease


::: notes
During wet winters bullfrogs move from upland cattle ponds and then when that is followed by a low precipitation year, their tadpoles can successfully over-winter in the absence of disturbance, and complete their life cycle, so in 2018 Stephanie Carlson and her group who had been monitoring the fish populations for several year started catching bullfrog tadpoles in the longest lasting pools.  This sets up a tradeoff for the native amphibians, if they breed in the most persistently wet places they face the negative effects of bullfrogs --, if they breed elsewhere they risk having their tadpoles not reach metamorphosis before the channel dewaters.  

In addition to being predators and competitors, bullfrogs are also tolerant hosts of Bd.  For example, otherwise healthy looking tadpoles can be so infected with chytrid fungus that the keratin on their mouthparts (tooth rows and beak) is de-pigmented.

::: notes

In summary, R. boylii does appear to be susceptible to Bd infection in the field when multiple stressors act together.
Our mixed effects models showed that bullfrogs are a strong predictor of both Bd prevalence and Bd load. In addition, sexstage, particularly being a male, is a significant predictor of whether a R. boylii individual will be infected. 
This photo shows a potential reason why males are more likely to be infected, males wrestle each other and congregate at the lek sites; male R. boylii mistake bullfrogs for large female boylii, this is a picture of a boylii in amplexus with a bullfrog. With direct contact with a known Bd reservoir like this, it is easy to imagine how males would be more infected.
Also, there was a significant effect of water year on infection. Interestingly, even though the outbreak happened in the early water year of 2014, Bd prevalence was actually much higher in 2015, and the male effect didn’t seem to matter as much.
We know that bullfrogs are usually asymptomatic carriers and can provide Bd  a reservoir; they can also spread bd to new regions as they disperse. We think that it is what is happening at the little Yosemite site since the year of the outbreak was the first year that bullfrogs were observed that far upstream.
Alternatively, stress induced on native species by competition or direct predation by bullfrogs may be suppress the immune system of R. boylii and they become infected.
When R. boylii become infected, the intensity of that infection is best predicted by stream flow, bullfrogs, season, and con-specific density. Decreasing bd loads with increasing streamflow is consistent with the hypothesis that a large volume of water dilutes the potential infective zoospore pool, and frogs can disperse throughout lotic environments in the watershed. 
As flows decrease, ephemeral reaches go dry and pools shrink, we would expect increased density-dependent transmission rates.
The take home message is that until now, not much was known about the effects of Bd on this species. Now we know that it is susceptible...
