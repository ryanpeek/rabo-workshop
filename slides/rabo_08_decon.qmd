# Decontamination Process {background-color="#111111" background-image="../img/decon_steps.png" background-size="contain" background-position="bottom"}


## Decon {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
 - Decontamination between and after sites is [critical]{.b .orange}
 - Before leaving a field site, thoroughly remove all organic matter (i.e., mud, algae, plants) from nets, sampling gear, boots/boot tread, clothing
 - Be especially cognizant of gear that came into contact with water or aquatic sediments
 
![](../img/muddy_boots.jpg){.br-100 fig-align="center" width=50%}

:::

## Decon Steps

::: {.f2 .incremental}

 1. Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, safety goggles):
      a. for all options listed, avoid getting concentrated, pre-solution chemical on your skin/eyes/cloths (See SDS for details)
 2. Pre-rinse with water [and scrub]{.b .orange} before cleaning with solution
 3. Clean with solution using appropriate dilution (Bleach, Quat, Virkon-S)
 4. Allow solution to sit for necessary time (depends on treatment, usually at least 5 minutes)
 5. Rinse off using clean water

## Decon Options

Two recent summaries of decontamination treatment options, their efficacy for various pathogens, and associated citations can be found here:

## Decon: Bleach {.smaller}

Recent guidance (see [here](https://parcplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Bletz.etal_.2023_NEPARCdecon1.pdf) and [here](https://parcplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Amping-up-Biosecurity-for-Herps.pdf)) recommend much higher concentrations of bleach...

 - [**Bleach at 1:20 concentration**]{.orange}: works well but hard on gear
 - Soak for minimum 5 min (10 min is ideal)
 - If exposed to air or sunlight the diluted solution will only last ~5 days
 - dispose of any unused bleach from an open bottle after 1 month, and inactivated quickly by organic material and sunlight so make a fresh batch if dirty!
 - For half a 5 gallon bucket, use 16 oz or 2 CUPS of standard concentrated household bleach

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Clorox_Bleach_products.jpg){.br-100 fig-align="center"}

::: notes

 - In fresh opaque container, will remain active for 1 month. If older, dispose and get new.
 - If exposed to sunlight or air, it will only last ~5 days.
 - Can use a 1:20 solution 5% solution for 5 min, which is about 3/4 C or 6 oz per gallon of water (see [Chellman & McKenny MYLF NPS document](https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/documents/MYLF%20Attachment%204_Decon%20Protocol.pdf).
 - Can use trash bag and transport water from water body upland to decon site.

:::

## Decon: Quat {.smaller}

 - [Quat-128 (%5 DDAC) or Quat-256 (10% DDAC)]{.b .orange}: 
    - To make 0.01% solution, (.25 oz / 0.5 TBSP / 7.5 mL) per gallon of water
    - With Quat 256, can use a 15 gallon tub with about 60 ml (2 oz) of quat
  - [Soak gear at least 5 minutes, 10 minutes ideal]{.b .orange}
 - If exposed to air or sunlight, the solution should be changed out at least once a month if using an opaque spray bottle
 - For half a 5 gallon bucket, need about 0.7 oz / 4 teaspoons / 20 mL)

![](../img/quat128.jpg){.br-100 fig-align="center"}

::: notes

 - In fresh opaque container, will remain active for 1 month. If older, dispose and get new.
 - If exposed to sunlight or air, it will only last ~5 days.

:::

## Decon: Virkon-S ![](../img/Virkon-S.jpg){.br-100 .absolute width=170px right=200px top=-40px}

 
 - Virkon-S (21.4% potassium peroxymonosulfate) (1.3 oz. / ~2.5 tablespoons) per gallon of water to make 1% solution
 - Soak gear for at least 2 minutes (5 minutes ideal)
 - Once solution is made, lasts about a week
 - For half of 5-gallon bucket, use about 3.25 oz or 6.5 tablespoons of powder
 - [Avoid contact of the powder with skin and clothing; very harmful if you get the concentrated powder in your eyes]{.b .red}

## Multiple Decontamination Methods Recommended! {.smaller}

[*Especially if transitioning between office/lab/field between sites*:]{.orange .b}

::: {.incremental}

 - Not all decontamination methods are appropriate for all circumstances
 - Choose the decontamination method(s) appropriate for the equipment being decontaminated and site-specific considerations
 - When possible, opt for the method effective for the most AIS and pathogens as possible
 - If multiple methods must be used, perform them sequentially, and never mix chemicals
 - [Great methods: chemical, then dry in hot sun for 24+ hours; or chemical, then freeze for 24+ hours]{.b .blue}
