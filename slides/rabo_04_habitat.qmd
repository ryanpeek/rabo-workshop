## Adult Habitat {.smaller}

<!--

Post-metamorphic R. boylii remain in terrestrial riparian and riverine habitat adjacent to the wetted channel during the non-breeding season (Bourque 2008, Kupferberg 1996, Lind et al. 1996, Moyle 1973, Van Wagner 1996, Zweifel 1955). Rana boylii have been documented in a wide range of habitats, but all generally occur within a short distance of flowing water (see Bourque 2008) although differences appear to vary both regionally and seasonally (Bourque 2008, Haggarty 2006, Van Wagner 1996, Yarnell 2000, Yarnell 2005).

## Breeding Habitat {.smaller}

::: {.columns .pv4}
::: {.column width="70%"}
1.  Amphibians have been on [earth]{.b .blue} since the [Devonian]{.b .green} 
    -   This is a long time

::: {.fragment .mt1}
2.  Worldwide declines of [amphibians]{.b .orange} has only occurred in **our** lifetimes
    -   This is not a long time
:::

::: {.fragment .mt1}
3.  [Aquatic ecosystems]{.b .blue} are at highest risk
    -   Amphibians form a link between the terrestrial and aquatic worlds
:::

::: {.fragment .mt1}
4.  [Sentinel]{.b .gold} species like Foothill yellow-legged frogs integrate energy of ecosystems
    - And can tell us much about the "health" of a system

## Rearing Habitat {.smaller}

::: {.columns .pv4}
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   This is a broad overview of the most current information about this **amazing** species

::: {.fragment .mt1}
-   We don't expect you all to be experts at the end, but rather, learn "[where to look...]{.b .blue}"
:::

::: {.fragment .mt1}
-   Through [lectures]{.b .blue} and [field time]{.b .green}, you will learn the life history, breeding ecology, and habitat use of this species
:::

::: {.fragment .mt1}
-   Field attendees will get direct [experience]{.b .green} doing surveys and evaluating habitat, as well as conducting egg mass surveys

## Overwintering Habitat {.smaller}

::: {.columns .pv4}
::: {.column width="70%" .incremental}
 
 - Very little data are available relating to overwintering habitat
 - Van Wagner (1996) observed *R. boylii* both in the water and along the stream-edge habitat beneath rocks, leaf litter, and Carex sp
 - Also found frogs appeared to be active whenever ambient conditions were favorable
 - Habitat use in large rivers may vary, juveniles & adults may move into smaller lateral tributaries to avoid risk of scouring (Kupferberg 1996)
 - Or move into adjacent terrestrial habitat to avoid winter flood events altogether.
